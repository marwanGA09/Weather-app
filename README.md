# Weather Forecast Site

This repository provides a user-friendly weather forecast site built with the WeatherAPI.

## Features

- Search for specific locations by entering a city name or ZIP code.
- Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature units.
- Leverages promises or async/await for asynchronous data fetching, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-forecast-site.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install required dependencies using your preferred package manager (e.g., npm or yarn):

```
npm install
```

### Obtain API Keys

- WeatherAPI: Create a free account on [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to obtain an API key.

### Configure API Keys

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory (ignore this file with Git) and add the following line, replacing `YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY` with your actual key:

```

This will typically launch the site at http://localhost:3000 (or a similar address) in your web browser.
